# Project for the Developing Data Products Coursera Class

The tool is fairly simple and straight-forward to use:

1) Enter the requested data (current age, age when pet was acquired and the pet's age when acquired).
2) The plot will update reactively.
3) There is a button to re-calculate the pet's age in human years. Click to update.
